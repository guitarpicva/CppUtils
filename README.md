# Ez Cpp Utils
Some helper utilities that we get used to from frameworks like Qt

When we have things like Qt's QString library, it's so darned convenient!
Why not keep that alive and make a few tools to use as well.

1. First up is "split" a string on a delimiter, keeping or discarding the empty tokens in the output std::vector

2. Get the day of year in the system time zone (1-366)

3. maidenhead.h adds Maidenhead locator to Lat/Lon converter
for the Hamster geeks!
